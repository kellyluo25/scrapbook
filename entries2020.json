    "description": "lara jean pulls a meredith grey—she just wants a boy to pick her, choose her, and love her—but the boy who does is john ambrose and suddenly it feels all wrong. some say the love triangle in this film is team peter vs. john ambrose, but the real triangle is between lara jean’s romantic ideals vs. unideal romance. she has this picture-perfect idea of what her first love should be like and this fantasy of a boy that she’s basically written into existence. but then lara jean realizes that heartbreak is very real and it hurts—and she learns that sometimes the realest parts in life are the things that make you *feel*. so this girl who writes love letters in her bedroom acknowledges that the fantasy isn’t real, but she does have something real right in front of her. what’s real is messy and a little broken and doesn’t fit neatly within the purple prose of her novels. but it doesn’t have to be perfect; it just has to be hers. so she picks."
